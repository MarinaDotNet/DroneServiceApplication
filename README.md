# Drone Service Application

## Overview
This application is designed to log and manage drones that require service and repair. It organizes drones into two service categories: Regular and Express. The Express service includes an additional 15% charge. The application uses two Queue<T> data structures to manage the order of service requests. Once a drone is repaired, it is removed from the appropriate queue and added to a list of completed work. The application includes full error trapping and displays feedback messages via a status strip at the bottom of the form. It is built using the Windows Forms Application Framework and .NET Core.

## Features
- **Queue-Based Service Management:**
  + Uses two Queue<T> structures to manage drones for Regular and Express service categories.

    * **Service Problem:** A description of the problem or service needed.
    * **Service Cost:** The base cost of the service.

**Express Service Charge:** The base service cost is increased by a 15% surcharge for Express service.
- **Dequeue and Complete Service:** Once repaired, the drone is removed from the queue and the details are added to the list of completed work.
- **Error Trapping and Feedback:** This includes full error handling, with feedback displayed in a status strip at the bottom of the form.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with Windows Forms, providing an intuitive interface for managing drone service requests.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C#
- **Framework:** .NET Core, Windows Forms
